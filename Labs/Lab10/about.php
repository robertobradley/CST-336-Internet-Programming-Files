<p>Here at CSUMB Animal Shelter adoptions we strive to give a friendly and deserving animal a home.</p>
<p>To give them a home we established a way to connect with students and find them the perfect partner.</p>
<p>We have partnered up with these facilities to better serve the public and our student's adoptions.</p>
